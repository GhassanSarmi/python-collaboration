A. Basic Functionalities
1.1 Define Time Blocks
Description: Divide the day into 20-minute intervals from 7 AM to 7 PM.
Input: None (predefined intervals)
Output: List of time intervals
Contribution: Forms the basic structure to simulate scheduling and staffing.

1.2 Assign Number of Employees per Time Block
Description: Allows the user to input how many employees are scheduled per time block (between 2–4).
Input: Integer values entered by user for each time block
Output: Time block schedule with employee count
Contribution: Controls staffing levels, which directly impact wait times and costs.

1.3 Mark Peak vs Non-Peak Time Blocks
Description: Identifies which blocks are peak hours.
Input: Predefined list of peak block indices
Output: Boolean flag for each block
Contribution: Differentiates customer arrival rates and wait time expectations.

1.4 Simulate Customer Arrivals and Wait Times
Description: Simulates daily customer flow and estimates wait times using Poisson and Exponential distributions.
Input: Time block schedule, arrival rate (λ), wait time lookup
Output: Average wait time per customer
Contribution: Core functionality to evaluate customer experience under current staffing.

1.5 Calculate Daily Labor Cost
Description: Computes total employee-hours and multiplies by hourly wage.
Input: Number of employees per block
Output: Total daily labor cost ($)
Contribution: Provides financial insight into the cost of staffing decisions.

1.6 Run Simulation Over Multiple Days
Description: Repeats daily simulation to get average wait time over several days (default 1000).
Input: Number of days
Output: Long-run average wait time
Contribution: Improves accuracy of results by accounting for randomness over time.
